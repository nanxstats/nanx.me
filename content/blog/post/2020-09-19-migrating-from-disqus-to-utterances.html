<p>Safari 14 introduced a new UI component that I cannot love more: a privacy report detailing all the third-party trackers blocked by WebKit’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Following this progress and <a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/remove-google-analytics/">removing Google Analytics</a> last year, I decide to finish my part today by purging Disqus (comes with unsolicited tracking) from this website.</p>

<p>The process is much easier than I thought. I would recommend this to anyone who prioritizes the online privacy of the readers. The following steps should generally work for most Hugo/blogdown sites.</p>
<p><strong>Set up utterances</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check out the <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utterances docs</a> to set up a GitHub repo with the utterances app installed for storing the comments in issues. I created a <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/blog-comments">dedicated new repo</a> for this.</li>
<li>Add the utterances partial to the theme. It includes adding a partial and calling it in <code>single.html</code>. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-nanx2020/commit/60e0c939775a7a85ff391c83d88512ddd19cd58f">changeset for my current theme</a>. Remove Disqus related variables such as <code>disqusShortname</code> in your site configuration file (e.g., <code>config.toml</code>). Set the utterances repo value if you have placed it as a <code>.Site.Params</code> variable, as I did in the partial template.</li>
<li>Recompile the site to see if the new system works. If it does, a GitHub issue style comment box should show up under every post.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Migrate comment data from Disqus</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Export the previous comments data via <code>Admin</code> &gt; <code>Community</code> &gt; <code>Export</code>. An XML file tarball will be sent via email.</li>
<li>Import comments into the new system. I did this by manually posting the original comments as there were only around 30 comments. I find the <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/">R script by Maëlle Salmon</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/7">formatting provided by Juergen Gutsch</a> useful. By doing this, we can also verify if the utterances bot works (new issues being created and comments being posted). For a higher number of comments, it might be worthwhile to automate via the GitHub issue comments API.</li>
<li>Since everything works beautifully with the new comment system, I chose to remove my site from Disqus so that they don’t keep an obvious copy of the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. Now every single page on this blogdown site is tracking free. Maybe it’s the placebo effect, but I can almost feel the pages loading faster. The side effect that a GitHub identity is required for commenting is enjoyable — it might actually improve the conversation’s quality.</p>
<p>Unlike Orpheus, I’m never looking back.</p>
