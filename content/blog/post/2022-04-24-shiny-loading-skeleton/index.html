<p>Let’s implement a “skeleton loader” for Shiny apps.
A typical animated skeleton loading screen looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Compared to the traditional loading screens provided by tools like
<a href="https://github.com/JohnCoene/waiter">waiter</a>,
the skeleton loading screen is a prominent way to show the app is currently
loading and can give users an idea of the incoming page structure.</p>
<p>We have to make a few decisions to build the skeleton loading screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can leverage the flexible
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/shiny-fcp-loader">shiny-fcp-loader</a>
template described in our <a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/shiny-fcp-loader/">previous post</a>
as the basis and only modify the loader code.</li>
<li>It would be ideal to use the same frontend framework as we used in the app UI
(Bootstrap 5) to construct the HTML part of this skeleton loader.</li>
<li>I found an excellent
<a href="https://codepen.io/taylorgorman/pen/GRojZwV">Bootstrap 5 loading skeleton example</a>
by Taylor Gorman for the CSS part. It uses minimal, pure CSS to stylize the
HTML UI components as skeletons and apply animation effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assembling the pieces is then quite simple.
The Shiny app template is available from
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/shiny-loading-skeleton" class="uri">https://github.com/nanxstats/shiny-loading-skeleton</a>.
You can preview the demo at <a href="https://nanx.shinyapps.io/shiny-loading-skeleton/" class="uri">https://nanx.shinyapps.io/shiny-loading-skeleton/</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few notes on how to experiment with the template.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app.R</code>
<ul>
<li>Comment out the <code>shinyjs::hide()</code> line to keep showing the loader.
This is useful because you might need to preview the loader for
a longer time before it matches the ideal appearance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>loader/loader.R</code>
<ul>
<li>Preview the UI components before they are stylized as skeletons
by removing the <code>loading-skeleton</code> class from the <code>container-fluid</code>
div of the loader.</li>
<li>Customize the loading skeleton using (almost) the same UI code
used for the landing page of your Shiny app: perhaps with a different
input ID or HTML constructed by <code>htmltools</code> calls.</li>
<li>Since the Shiny (or bslib) Bootstrap CSS is not fetched yet when the loader
is rendered, we need to load our copy manually as a dependency
so that the loader’s HTML components are correctly positioned and stylized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>loader/loader.css</code>
<ul>
<li>Add more names to the <code>.loading-skeleton</code> selector to cover more
component types.</li>
<li>In this template, we ported two rules from Shiny-specific component
styles to ensure the loader components won’t shift on screen after the
Shiny CSS files are loaded.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
