<p>Runtime errors can be tricky and costly to resolve for any programming language, and these errors frequently happen when <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/connections.html">managing (file) connections</a>. Boris posted such an <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/Rcpi/issues/9">issue</a> when using my R package <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/Rcpi/">Rcpi</a>. I rephrase it here as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;Rcpi&quot;)

dir.create(&quot;test&quot;)
for (i in 1:2000) {
  file.copy(
    system.file(&quot;compseq/DB00530.sdf&quot;, package = &quot;Rcpi&quot;),
    paste0(&quot;test/&quot;, i, &quot;.sdf&quot;)
  )
}

fns &lt;- list.files(&quot;test/&quot;, pattern = &quot;.sdf$&quot;, full.names = TRUE)

for (i in 1:length(fns)) {
  cat(&quot;\014&quot;, i, &quot;\n&quot;)
  Rcpi::convMolFormat(infile = fns[i], outfile = &quot;temp.smi&quot;, from = &quot;sdf&quot;, to = &quot;smiles&quot;)
  Rcpi::readMolFromSmi(smifile = &quot;temp.smi&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;)[1]
}</code></pre>
<p>The purpose of the code is simple: convert a collection of files existing in the SDF format to SMILES format (both are common chemical file formats), then read the SMILES format files as character strings sequentially. Nothing surprising.</p>
<p>However, after looping over about 500 input files, R yields an error saying:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Error in file(file, &quot;r&quot;) : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, &quot;r&quot;) : cannot open file &#39;temp.smi&#39;: Too many open files</code></pre>
<p>This is because there are certain limits on the number of connections one can open in R. See Matthew Shotwell’s <a href="https://biostatmatt.com/R/R-conn-ints.pdf">R Connection Internals</a> for technical details. If we look closely, the connection-related code is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in input_files) {
  read_compute_write(input = i, output = &quot;output_file&quot;)
  read_file(&quot;output_file&quot;)
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>read_compute_write()</code> function is a wrapper of a function from another package that uses C++ to open low-level connections to read and write files, and <code>read_file()</code> uses R’s native <code>scan()</code> to read files. More often than not, there could be additional operations that manipulate connections in the for loop.</p>
<p>In such situations, I usually do not want to spend a few hours fighting with the “proper” solution — manual connection life cycle management. This is not so dissimilar with garbage collection (GC) in memory management — although you want to enjoy the manual control once a while, sometimes you wish it to be automatic.</p>
<p>What could be an alternative solution? Since the core issue here is that one R process cannot open many connections at once, what if we open a below-the-limit number of connections in separate child R processes, do the computation, and collect the results back to the parent process? Yes, this is easily doable via the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=callr">callr</a> package if you haven’t heard of it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;Rcpi&quot;)
library(&quot;callr&quot;)

dir.create(&quot;test&quot;)
for (i in 1:2000) {
  file.copy(
    system.file(&quot;compseq/DB00530.sdf&quot;, package = &quot;Rcpi&quot;),
    paste0(&quot;test/&quot;, i, &quot;.sdf&quot;)
  )
}

fns &lt;- list.files(&quot;test/&quot;, pattern = &quot;.sdf$&quot;, full.names = TRUE)

convert &lt;- function(fns, idx) {
  callr::r(function(fns, idx) {
    smiles &lt;- c()
    for (i in idx) {
      Rcpi::convMolFormat(
        infile = fns[i], outfile = &quot;temp.smi&quot;, from = &quot;sdf&quot;, to = &quot;smiles&quot;
      )
      smiles &lt;- c(smiles, Rcpi::readMolFromSmi(smifile = &quot;temp.smi&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;)[1])
    }
    smiles
  }, args = list(fns, idx))
}


k &lt;- length(fns)
chunks &lt;- split(1:k, ceiling(seq_along(1:k) / 400))
smi &lt;- rep(NA, k)
for (i in 1:length(chunks)) smi[chunks[[i]]] &lt;- convert(fns, chunks[[i]])
smi</code></pre>
<p>The code can still be further vectorized, but you got the idea. Note that extending such a workaround to other use cases may create an antipattern. Although I do not think writing “disposable code” for “disposable computing” is a problem if it gets the work done, I do not recommend such approaches either unless you are in a hurry.</p>
