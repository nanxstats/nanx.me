  r-rust-pkgs is a curated GitHub repository that collects R packages
  on CRAN that use Rust. It provides a centralized resource for finding
  high-performance R packages built with Rust, leveraging Rust's strong
  ecosystem and memory safety features.

<h2>Rust in R packages</h2>
<p>Rust has been the <a href="https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/why-rust-is-the-most-admired-language-among-developers/">most admired programming
language</a>
for nearly a decade.
CRAN, the largest public repository for R packages,
has also <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/using_rust.html">supported integrating Rust in R packages</a> for several years. What’s the magic behind the language?</p>
<p>To me, Rust is a great choice for writing high-performance extensions for
both R and Python, offering memory safety and a strong ecosystem.
Python has maturin and pyo3, while R benefits from
<a href="https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/">rextendr</a>, an R package that simplifies
scaffolding and interfacing with Rust.
All of these came from <a href="https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/07/06/r-consortium-funded-project-extendr-provides-rust-extensions-for-r">outstanding community
contributions</a>
that make writing Rust-powered R packages much easier.
For an introduction, I recommend checking out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRm-Qq2_Ap0">Josiah Parry’s video tutorial</a>,
which perfectly explains the R + Rust development workflow.</p>

<div id="why-this-list" class="section level2">
<h2>Why this list?</h2>
<p>When learning a new programming language, I often study real-world package
examples to understand language-specific engineering best practices.
However, to my knowledge, there has not been a centralized way to find
R packages that use Rust. To address this, I created
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs"><strong>nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs</strong></a>,
a GitHub repository listing CRAN packages that contain Rust code
in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The list is automatically generated by scanning CRAN package <code>DESCRIPTION</code>
files where <code>SystemRequirements</code> contains <code>Cargo</code> (the Rust package manager).
Currently, it includes 27 packages. To update the list, simply fork the repo,
render the <code>README.Rmd</code> file, and submit a pull request.</p>
