<p>I’m delighted to share that our paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2024.2334354"><em>Some Group Sequential Trials From
Industry Over the Last 30 Years</em></a>,
has been published in <em>Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research</em>.

<div id="key-takeaways" class="section level2">
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<p>The paper began as a <a href="https://keaven.github.io/talks/">conference talk</a>
presented by <a href="https://keaven.github.io/">Keaven</a>, our lead author, in 2022.
Recognizing the value of these stories, we decided to develop them into
a full-length paper. The peer review process significantly improved the
quality of our work, and we are grateful for the reviewers’
constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Our paper discussed how group sequential design has been applied in
industry trials over the past three decades. Besides a concise review of theory,
it offers an informed perspective into the flexibility of group sequential
design in solving challenges compared to more complex adaptive designs.
We emphasized important considerations such as timing of interim analyses,
boundary setting for interim and final analyses, and handling multiple
hypotheses created by dose groups, populations, and endpoints.</p>

<div id="highlights" class="section level2">
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>What sets this paper apart is its use of real-world examples to
illustrate the intellectual challenges and practical solutions in trial design.
Keaven carefully selected several representative trials that showcase the
advantages of group sequential design. These include but are not limited to
practical benefits like early futility analysis and facilitating fast
decision-making in trials with significant efficacy or safety outcomes.</p>
<p>Naturally, the paper discusses the use of open source
R packages, such as <a href="https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/">gsDesign</a>,
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/">gsDesign2</a>, and
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gMCPLite/">gMCPLite</a>, for creating group sequential designs.
These tools provide the flexibility needed to design and analyze group
sequential trials, including features for flexible timing and spending,
non-proportional hazards, and stratified populations. They were also used
to generate the designs presented in the paper’s tables and figures.</p>

<div id="behind-the-scenes-write-publication-quality-papers-using-r-markdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Behind the scenes: write publication-quality papers using R Markdown</h2>
<p>For those interested in the technical aspects, we used a plain text workflow
to write the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gsDesign</strong>, <strong>gsDesign2</strong>, and <strong>gMCPLite</strong> for producing the
designs, tabular summaries, and visualizations.</li>
<li><strong>R Markdown</strong> for technical writing and publishing.</li>
<li><strong>Git</strong> for version control and team collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we leveraged the following tools to produce high-quality PDF
outputs. They helped us meet the style and formatting standards
while keeping the Markdown simple so that we could focus on the content.</p>
<div id="template" class="section level3">
<h3>Template</h3>
<p>We used the <a href="https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html#asa---asa-journal-article">ASA article template</a>
from the <a href="https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/">rticles</a> package.
This template helped us meet the journal formatting requirements.
It also provided a convenient <code>blinded</code> option for producing
double-anonymized review PDFs.</p>
</div>
<div id="table" class="section level3">
<h3>Table</h3>
<p>Most design summary tables were generated with R and piped into
<a href="https://gt.rstudio.com/">gt</a> to produce nicely formatted LaTeX tables.
For simpler, manually crafted Markdown tables,
<a href="https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/8.9-tables.html#extension-pipe_tables">pipe tables</a>
offered precise column alignment control.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-look-and-feel" class="section level3">
<h3>Figure look and feel</h3>
<p>Key elements of our figure design include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/themes.html"><code>cowplot::theme_cowplot()</code></a>
for its sensible default appearance.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/plot_grid.html"><code>cowplot::plot_grid()</code></a>
for arranging multi-panel figures.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/">ggrepel</a> for physics-based text label
placement to avoid overlap.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://merck.github.io/gMCPLite/reference/hGraph.html"><code>gMCPLite::hGraph()</code></a>
to create elliptical multiplicity graphs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="figure-production" class="section level3">
<h3>Figure production</h3>
<p>We used the Cairo PDF device by setting <code>dev = "cairo_pdf"</code> in knitr chunk
options to correctly render Unicode characters (such as Greek letters) in plots.</p>
</div>
<div id="latex-fine-tuning" class="section level3">
<h3>LaTeX fine-tuning</h3>
<p>We <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-knit.html">customized the knit button behavior</a>
using the <code>knit</code> option in the YAML header. This trick allowed us to
programmatically parse and process the intermediate LaTeX output before
rendering it into PDF. It can help address issues in the original LaTeX
output, for example, making the gt table captions numbered and resetting
the table font sizes.</p>

<div id="looking-ahead" class="section level2">
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>I hope this paper serves as a valuable reference for statisticians and
clinical researchers interested in implementing group sequential designs
in their trials. It aims to contribute to ongoing discussions and
statistical methodology research on efficient, effective clinical trial design.</p>
