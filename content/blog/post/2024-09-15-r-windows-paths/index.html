<p>I’m glad to share a new repository that documents the essential R command-line
tool paths on Windows: <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/r-windows-paths" class="uri">https://github.com/nanxstats/r-windows-paths</a>.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>As an R developer, I frequently set up new development and testing environments
for my R packages on Windows. This process often involves installing several
command-line tools alongside R, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rtools</strong>: Compiles C/C++/Fortran code.</li>
<li><strong>TinyTeX</strong>: Compiles reference manual and PDF vignettes.</li>
<li><strong>Pandoc</strong>: Renders R Markdown (v2) vignettes.</li>
<li><strong>Quarto</strong>: Renders Quarto vignettes.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the growing list of command-line tools, locating their installed
directories and making them accessible via the command line has become
increasingly time-consuming. I feel something can be done to make it better.</p>
</div>
<div id="documenting-the-paths" class="section level2">
<h2>Documenting the paths</h2>
<p>The first step in making the environment setup process more productive and
standardized is to document the canonical installation paths.
This information needs to be more centrally and formally documented online.
To address this, I created a GitHub repository listing the important paths:
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/r-windows-paths" class="uri">https://github.com/nanxstats/r-windows-paths</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, modifying the <code>PATH</code> environment variable on Windows via
the GUI is less straightforward than editing plaintext configuration
files on Linux or macOS. Therefore, I wrote a brief guide for configuring
the <code>PATH</code> environment variable with screenshots in <code>path.md</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="automatic-version-updates" class="section level2">
<h2>Automatic version updates</h2>
<p>Some software paths depend on software versions, such as R, Rtools,
and RStudio IDE. I implemented a simple scraping mechanism to fetch the
latest release versions from reliable sources, even though they don’t
provide official APIs. This automation allows the repository to stay updated
easily without manual checks. See the R code chunk in <code>README.Rmd</code> for
the implementation.</p>

<h2>Am I missing something?</h2>
<p>If you know of any important Windows command-line tools that integrate with R
and are not included, please submit a pull request to help expand the list.</p>
