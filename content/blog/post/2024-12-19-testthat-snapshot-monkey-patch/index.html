<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Snapshot testing has been supported in testthat since
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/10/testthat-3-0-0/#snapshot-testing">testthat 3.0.0</a>.
By default, snapshot files are saved to a hardcoded directory:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>tests/testthat/_snaps/</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, testthat does not provide a public API to customize this directory.
This question has been raised in issues like
<a href="https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1623">r-lib/testthat#1623</a>,
suggesting that customizing the snapshot directory is a valid use case.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Without a public API, the most practical solution is to modify testthatâ€™s
internal behavior <strong>at runtime</strong> through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>.
This approach avoids creating a custom version of testthat while allowing
the flexibility we need.</p>
<p>In R, monkey patching can be easily implemented using namespace utility functions.
For example, David Lukes
<a href="https://dlukes.github.io/monkey-patching-in-r.html">described this approach</a>
for customizing the range filter behavior in the DT package.</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates how to change the testthat snapshot directory
by patching relevant internal functions. Add it to <code>tests/testthat/helper.R</code>
or another <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files">testthat helper file</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; Modify a testthat function to use a different snapshot directory at runtime
#&#39;
#&#39; @param f Function name to modify.
#&#39; @param new New snapshot directory path.
#&#39; @param old Old snapshot directory path. Defaults to `&quot;_snaps&quot;`.
set_snapshot_dir &lt;- function(f, new, old = &quot;_snaps&quot;) {
  func &lt;- getFromNamespace(f, ns = &quot;testthat&quot;)
  code &lt;- deparse(body(func))
  code &lt;- gsub(sprintf(&#39;&quot;%s&quot;&#39;, old), sprintf(&#39;&quot;%s&quot;&#39;, new), code, fixed = TRUE)
  body(func) &lt;- parse(text = paste(code, collapse = &quot;\n&quot;))
  assignInNamespace(f, func, ns = &quot;testthat&quot;)
}

set_snapshot_dir(&quot;test_files_reporter&quot;, &quot;_snapshots&quot;)
set_snapshot_dir(&quot;snapshot_meta&quot;, &quot;_snapshots&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>With this code, snapshots will be saved to <code>tests/testthat/_snapshots/</code>
instead of <code>tests/testthat/_snaps/</code>.
This approach has been tested with testthat 3.2.2
(the latest release at the time of writing) and retains the original
snapshot testing behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>expect_snapshot()</code> and <code>expect_snapshot_file()</code> as usual.</li>
<li>The tests run successfully with <code>devtools::test()</code> and <code>R CMD check</code>
without additional notes, warnings, or errors.</li>
<li>Repeated test runs do not cause issues, even with the patched functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative paths are also supported for custom paths. For example, to save
snapshots in a directory parallel to your package/project directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set_snapshot_dir(&quot;test_files_reporter&quot;, &quot;../../../testdata/_snapshots&quot;)
set_snapshot_dir(&quot;snapshot_meta&quot;, &quot;../../../testdata/_snapshots&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="caveats" class="section level2">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<div id="dependency-on-testthat-version" class="section level3">
<h3>Dependency on testthat version</h3>
<p>Monkey patching relies on the internal structure of testthat, which may change
in future versions. To avoid compatibility issues, consider using a dependency
management tool like renv or
<a href="https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/environments/shared/">shared baselines</a>
to lock down specific package versions in your project.</p>
</div>
<div id="avoid-absolute-paths" class="section level3">
<h3>Avoid absolute paths</h3>
<p>Avoid using absolute paths for custom snapshot directories. They will reduce
the portability of your tests across different environments and platforms.
Relative paths are more robust, as they depend only on the structure of your
project(s) rather than the file system setup.</p>
