<p>Maintaining R packages is a significant time and effort commitment.
The <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/release.html">Releasing to CRAN</a> chapter of the
<em>R Packages</em> book provides an excellent overview of the many responsibilities
package authors face.
Henrik’s <a href="https://www.cranhaven.org/">CRANhaven</a> also helps me appreciate
the efforts made by both CRAN maintainers and package maintainers to
keep a consistent, high standard on software quality and integration within
a single, trusted repository.</p>
<p>As a package maintainer myself, I currently oversee
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_me_at_nanx.me.html">10 personal packages on CRAN</a>,
most of which originated from previous research activities.
This Spring, I took some time to clean up the issues in half of these packages.
This post documents the most important improvements.</p>
<div id="ggsci-3.0.3" class="section level2">
<h2>ggsci 3.0.3</h2>
<p><a href="https://nanx.me/ggsci/">ggsci</a> is a ggplot2 extension package
offering various color scales.
ggsci 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 resolved some compatibility issues with ggplot 3.5.0.
Specifically, ggplot2 3.5.0 deprecated the <code>scale_name</code> argument
in <code>discrete_scale()</code>. This will generate warning messages when users
call any color scale functions that did not remove this argument
when using ggplot2 &gt;= 3.5.0:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Warning message:
The `scale_name` argument of `discrete_scale()` is deprecated as of
ggplot2 3.5.0.</code></pre>
<p>However, if we simply remove this argument in the color scale functions,
R will complain under ggplot2 &lt; 3.5.0 because this was a required argument:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Error in `discrete_scale()`:
! argument &quot;scale_name&quot; is missing, with no default
Backtrace:
 1. ggsci::scale_color_*()
 2. ggplot2::discrete_scale(...)
 3. ggplot2::ggproto(...)
 4. rlang::list2(...)
Execution halted</code></pre>
<p>To maximize compatibility without requiring a recent minimum ggplot2
version, I implemented a more cautious approach by
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/ggsci/pull/30">detecting the installed ggplot2 version at runtime</a>
and use different <code>discrete_scale()</code> calls based on the detected version.
The internal functions I borrowed from the shiny package,
such as <code>is_installed()</code>, are effective in solving this version detection
problem (although a bit complicated).</p>
</div>
<div id="protr-1.7-1" class="section level2">
<h2>protr 1.7-1</h2>
<p><a href="https://nanx.me/protr/">protr</a> is a package for protein sequence
feature engineering.</p>
<p>protr 1.7-1 brings <code>crossSetSim()</code> to feature parity
with <code>parSeqSim()</code>. First, it extends <code>crossSetSim()</code>
<a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/protr-1-7-0/">added in protr 1.7-0</a>
to further support splitting similarity computation into batches
and displaying computation progress.
It also introduces a new function <code>crossSetSimDisk()</code> to offload the
intermediate results from each batch to disk and merge them at the end,
similar to the logic in <code>parSeqSimDisk()</code>.</p>
<p>These enhancements might help scale your similarity computation between
protein sequence sets when being bounded by available RAM, given
the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(mn)\)</span> space complexity.
However, specific situations may require further custom optimizations.
Of course, using high-memory machines
is a simple alternative solution.</p>

<div id="msaenet-3.1.1" class="section level2">
<h2>msaenet 3.1.1</h2>
<p><a href="https://nanx.me/msaenet/">msaenet</a> helps users explore
the solution space of adaptive estimations when building sparse linear models,
by supporting arbitrary numbers of adaptive estimation steps,
initialization methods, and automatic parameter tuning. A previous post
demonstrated how it can generate parsimonious solutions when modeling the
<a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/sparse-index-tracking/">sparse index tracking</a>
problem.</p>
<p>msaenet 3.1.1 resolves <code>R CMD check</code> notes and code example warnings
accumulated from R version and dependency updates.
It also improves code style and adopts proper three-number semantic versioning.</p>

<div id="where-do-we-go-from-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>I believe that proper delegation and transition of maintainership
is critical for the long-term health and sustainability of open source projects.
I have tried a few times in the past years to find new maintainers for
my packages—if you are interested in taking some responsibilities,
please reach out.</p>
