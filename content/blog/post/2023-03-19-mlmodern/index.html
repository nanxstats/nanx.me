  MLModern is a sturdy rendition of the Computer Modern typeface, offering
  a thicker and more legible design that is perfect for HiDPI and Retina
  displays. With MLModern, you can enhance the typography of your PDF documents
  and make them more readable. This blog post provides detailed instructions
  on how to install and use MLModern with both R Markdown and Quarto,
  and includes code examples to help you get started.

<p>You probably have created PDF documents using R Markdown or Quarto.
The default look and feel of these documents are driven by the default typeface,
Computer Modern, or its extended implementation, Latin Modern.</p>
<p>To me, these default typefaces work fine, but they could be “thicker” to be
more legible on HiDPI and Retina displays. <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/mlmodern">MLModern</a>
offers such a sturdy rendition of the Computer Modern design.
It was kindly contributed by Daniel Benjamin Miller and was first published
on CTAN in January 2021.</p>
<div id="specimen" class="section level2">
<h2>Specimen</h2>
<p>For direct use with LaTeX, you can preview MLModern on the
<a href="https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/mlmodern/">LaTeX Font Catalogue</a>.
As I often generate LaTeX-rendered PDF documents via R Markdown and Quarto,
I created a GitHub repo at
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/rmarkdown-quarto-mlmodern">nanxstats/rmarkdown-quarto-mlmodern</a>
to store examples specifically using these publishing systems.</p>
<p>MLModern covers the serif, sans-serif, and monospace variants that are
available in Latin Modern.
As of March 2023, MLModern is available in TFM and Type 1 formats,
although OpenType support is planned for the future.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/p4r53g/where_can_i_get_the_mlmodern_font_as_a_ttf_file/">Someone on Reddit</a>
was able to convert the Type 1 version to TTF.</p>

<div id="install-mlmodern" class="section level2">
<h2>Install MLModern</h2>
<p>MLModern is included in TeXLive &gt;= 2021. If you did not install the
full distribution, you can install the LaTeX package from CTAN:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>(sudo) tlmgr install mlmodern</code></pre>
<p>If you use TinyTeX, run the following in R to install the LaTeX package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tinytex::tlmgr_install(&quot;mlmodern&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="using-mlmodern-with-r-markdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Using MLModern with R Markdown</h2>
<p>For PDF documents rendered by the rmarkdown package and the default
pdflatex engine, use the <code>extra_dependencies</code> option to
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-extra.html">include additional LaTeX packages</a>:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: [&quot;mlmodern&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Conveniently, for PDF article templates in
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rticles">rticles</a> that use Computer Modern or
Latin Modern as the default typeface, such as <code>arxiv_article()</code> and
<code>asa_article()</code>, you can add the same option to the YAML header to use MLModern.</p>
<p>To use MLModern with R Markdown + XeLaTeX engine, it will be a bit different:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>output:
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: &quot;xelatex&quot;
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{mlmodern}
  - \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code></pre>
<p>When combining XeLaTeX and the current version of MLModern,
an issue encountered in my specimen repo was problematic math rendering,
but I have not found a solution yet.
Please let me know in the repo if you know a solution.</p>
<style type="text/css">
.callout {
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    margin-top: 1.25rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.25rem;
    padding-top: 1.875rem;
    padding-left: 1rem;
    padding-right: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    border-left: 5px solid #64748b;
    border-right: 1px solid #dee2e6;
    border-top: 1px solid #dee2e6;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6;
}
</style>
<div class="callout">
<p>Although it is okay to use the mlmodern and fontenc package with XeLaTeX,
it might not be the optimal choice. It is recommended to use OpenType (OTF)
fonts whenever possible with XeLaTeX since they offer more advanced
typographic features and are supported better by modern applications.</p>

<h2>Using MLModern with Quarto</h2>
<p>The Quarto <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#latex-includes">LaTeX includes</a>
syntax offers several options to use additional LaTeX packages.
For example, we can use the <code>text</code> sub key under <code>include-in-header</code>.
Since Quarto uses XeLaTeX by default, we can write:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>format:
  pdf:
    include-in-header:
      text: |
        \usepackage{mlmodern}
        \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code></pre>
<p>Or, render with the pdflatex engine to avoid the math rendering issue:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>pdf-engine: pdflatex
format:
  pdf:
    include-in-header:
      text: |
        \usepackage{mlmodern}
        \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code></pre>
<p>I hope MLModern can help improve the readability of your PDF documents.</p>
