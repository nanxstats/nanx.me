  letter spacing. This post introduces a set of CSS presets to easily
  adjust its appearance for optimal readability in your web projects.

<p>Since its open source release in 2017, <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> has
become a widely adopted sans-serif font, especially popular for web content
and user interfaces that benefit from a clean, neo-grotesque style.
Thoughtful glyph redesigns in versions 4.0 and 4.1 (released since 2023)
have further enhanced its technical maturity and visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning Inter’s appearance</h2>
<p>While Inter is well-designed out of the box, its default letter spacing can
sometimes feel a bit loose to me, depending on the context.
Fortunately, Inter is a versatile <strong>variable font</strong> with a rich set of
OpenType features. These features provide control over its appearance
directly within CSS.</p>
</div>
<div id="optical-sizing-and-letter-spacing" class="section level2">
<h2>Optical sizing and letter spacing</h2>
<p>One particularly useful feature for adjusting the Inter’s open spacing
presentation is the optical size (<code>opsz</code>) axis. In variable fonts, this axis
often adjusts details like stroke weight and letter shapes to optimize
readability at specific font sizes. When combined with the standard
<code>letter-spacing</code> CSS property, the <code>opsz</code> axis allows for precise control over
the perceived spacing and texture of the text.</p>
<p>The inclusion of an optical size axis also highlights the quality and effort invested
in Inter’s development. Currently, only a small number of typefaces (around 26) on
Google Fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts?vfaxis=opsz">offer the opsz feature</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="opinionated-inter-optical-sizing-presets" class="section level2">
<h2>Opinionated Inter optical sizing presets</h2>
<p>To make it easier to achieve a specific typographic feel with Inter,
I have created a set of reusable optical sizing presets in this
GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/inter-optical-sizing">nanxstats/inter-optical-sizing</a>.</p>
<p>The goal was to find <code>opsz</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> values that allow Inter to
closely match the visual spacing characteristics of the San Francisco typeface
when rendered at identical font weights and sizes.
I have manually curated values for common font weights (400, 450, 500, 600, 700)
and a typical range of font sizes (12px to 24px for regular text,
28px to 80px for display text).</p>
<p>The repository provides Sass (<code>.scss</code>) files that compile into CSS.
Here is a simple example of how to apply these presets in CSS:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>@import url(&quot;https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css&quot;);
@import url(&quot;inter-optical-sizing.min.css&quot;);

.content .markdown {
  font-size: 1.25rem; /* Corresponds to 20px if base is 16px */
  font-weight: 450;
  font-variation-settings: &quot;opsz&quot; var(--inter-opsz-20-450);
  letter-spacing: var(--inter-ls-20-450);
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="how-the-presets-were-made" class="section level2">
<h2>How the presets were made</h2>
<p>To determine these specific <code>opsz</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> values, I developed
a small JavaScript tool <a href="https://nanx.me/font-overlay/">font overlay</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/font-overlay">repo</a>).
This tool helps find suitable parameters by visually comparing and overlaying
the two fonts directly in the browser. While developed for this project,
this visual comparison approach could be adapted for other font pairings.</p>
