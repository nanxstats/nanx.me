<p>I am thrilled to share that our paper,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17407745221123244"><em>Electronic Common Technical Document Submission with Analysis Using R</em></a>,
is published online today in <em>Clinical Trials</em>.
We have selected the open access (OA) option to ensure that everyone in the
community can check out the full text freely.</p>

<h2>A simple solution to a complex problem</h2>
<p>Our article presented a viable path to prepare proprietary R assets for submission,
following the
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/electronic-regulatory-submission-and-review/electronic-common-technical-document-ectd">electronic common technical document</a>
(eCTD) specification.
The goal is to make the submission document self-contained, easy to
create, transfer, restore, review, and submit, with confidence in
transparency and reproducibility for both submitters and reviewers.</p>
<p>The workflow is built upon the idea of organizing the submission assets
as R packages. Our tool, <a href="https://github.com/merck/pkglite">pkglite</a>,
can convert the proprietary source R packages with the analysis code into
a compact text format and restore/install later.
We provided real-world examples and templates, so you can try them out today.
We also highlighted the successful pilot 1 open source submission
from the R Consortium
<a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">R submission working group</a>,
leveraging the solution and workflow.
More details of the workflow have been documented in our bookdown project
<a href="https://r4csr.org/"><em>R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission</em></a>.</p>

<h2>A few more words on pkglite</h2>
<p>The pkglite package has accumulated 15k total downloads from the
RStudio CRAN mirror.
As a simple, generic text file-based dependency distribution solution for R,
we have observed many other creative use cases for pkglite since it was
first published on CRAN in March 2021.</p>

<p>We hope pkglite can continue to deliver
value to people who need a lightweight R package exchange and distribution solution.
We have some good ideas to further develop the toolchain. You can see
them from my R/Pharma conference talk last year on
<a href="https://nanx.me/talks/reimagine-rpkgs/">reimagining the R package distribution system for reproducible research and submissions</a>.</p>
