  Introducing tinyvdiff, a minimalist pytest plugin for visual regression
  testing in Python. Designed for reproducible workflows, tinyvdiff converts
  PDFs into SVG snapshots for comparing appearance changes in graphics and
  documents. This post explores its motivation, methodology, and use cases.

<p>I’m delighted to announce my second Python package,
<a href="https://nanx.me/tinyvdiff/">tinyvdiff</a>, now available on PyPI.
It offers a lightweight pytest plugin for detecting appearance changes
in visual content, such as figures or documents. You can install it with:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>pip install tinyvdiff</code></pre>
<div id="setup-and-usage" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup and usage</h2>
<p>Here is an example test for matplotlib graphics,
from the <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/tinyvdiff-demo">tinyvdiff demo project</a>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import pytest

from tinyvdiff_demo.matplotlib import generate_plot


@pytest.fixture
def temp_pdf(tmp_path):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Fixture to create a temporary PDF file path&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return tmp_path / &quot;test.pdf&quot;


def test_matplotlib_visual(tinyvdiff, temp_pdf):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Test visual regression with PDF generated with matplotlib&quot;&quot;&quot;
    pdf_path = generate_plot(temp_pdf)
    tinyvdiff.assert_pdf_snapshot(pdf_path, &quot;snapshot_matplotlib.svg&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://nanx.me/tinyvdiff/articles/setup/">setup guide</a> to learn
how to integrate tinyvdiff into your Python project and use it
in CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>While transitioning parts of my toolchain to Python, I encountered a need
for a unified approach to test the visual appearance of rendered outputs,
such as graphics and documents.
In R, tools like <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/snapshotting.html">testthat snapshot
tests</a> and
<a href="https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/">vdiffr</a> address similar needs effectively.
However, with all the flexibility, I saw an opportunity to explore this
space a bit more in Python.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-trilemma" class="section level2">
<h2>The trilemma</h2>
<p>The design considerations for tinyvdiff are detailed in its
<a href="https://nanx.me/tinyvdiff/articles/design/">design document</a>.
In brief, I identified three key requirements that define a trilemma
for visual regression testing:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Support for diverse input formats</strong>:
Handle graphics and documents produced by different backends.</li>
<li><strong>Bitwise reproducibility of snapshots</strong>:
Store snapshots in plain text for easy version control and comparison.</li>
<li><strong>Environment consistency</strong>:
Generate consistent snapshots across operating systems.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="my-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>My solution</h2>
<p>Given the constraints of this trilemma:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropping constraints 2 and 3 leads to testthat “whole file snapshotting”.</li>
<li>Dropping constraint 1 while keeping 2 and 3 leads to vdiffr.</li>
<li>Dropping constraint 3 while keeping 1 and 2 gives tinyvdiff.</li>
</ul>
<p>tinyvdiff operates on the assumption that visual regression tests will be
running on a single platform. Developers are also trusted to prepare
reproducible PDF inputs in their preferred way.
The package then uses <code>pdf2svg</code> (built on Poppler and Cairo) to
convert PDF files into SVG snapshots for comparison.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-cases" class="section level2">
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>tinyvdiff may be a good fit for projects where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual tests can be sufficiently done on a single platform.</li>
<li>Multiple types of visual content require appearance testing.</li>
<li>PDF inputs are reproducible and contain mostly vector elements.</li>
<li>Snapshots remain manageable in size and complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these conditions are not met, other more focused approaches
might better suit your needs. For example, matplotlib has built-in
<a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/testing_api.html">testing helpers for image comparison</a>,
which works great for testing the appearance of its outputs.</p>
