<p>Apparently, I underestimated the severity of the ongoing GPU shortage
when I decided to Marie Kondo my
<a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/building-my-first-deep-learning-machine/">previous PC build</a>
and build a new one: people almost cannot find ANY graphics cards
at a reasonable price for a custom build.
After checking a few prebuilt options where one does not need to find a card,
I still feel all the options out there are not optimal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my solution is to find the cheapest possible
“new previous generation” card, and not compromising any other components.
Here is my <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/nanx999/saved/3TZN6h">pcpartpicker list</a>.</p>

<p>With the previous experience, this build was relatively easy.
Installing the AIO CPU liquid cooler might be a bit more complicated
than expected since I had to reverse the direction of the fans and ensure
all the plates and screws were set in the proper place.</p>
