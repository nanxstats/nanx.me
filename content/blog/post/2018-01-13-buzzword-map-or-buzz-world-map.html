<p>I don’t always care about popular topics because they usually fade fast.
But when I do, here is a 2017 world interest map for deep learning,
artificial intelligence, and blockchain (courtesy of Google Trends,
where you can reproduce it).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure: Google Trends — comparing the search traffic in 2017.</p>
</div>
<p>The dominant color shown in each region represents the most searched term there.
The question is, what does this map tell us — everything, or nothing at all?
I guess people will have a variety of answers. :)</p>
