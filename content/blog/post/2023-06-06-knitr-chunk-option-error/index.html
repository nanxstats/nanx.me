  This post explains a common but confusing error message from knitr when
  rendering R Markdown or Quarto documents where a character value is
  assigned to a chunk option that only accepts numeric values.

<p>If Google leads you here, you probably have assigned a character value
to a knitr chunk option such as <code>fig.width</code> or <code>fig.height</code>
that only accepts numeric values, and your are trying to render
that R Markdown or Quarto document.</p>
<p>For example, it is easy to make this mistake:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, fig.width=&quot;100%&quot;}
plot(1:10)
```</code></pre>
<p>where you probably meant:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, fig.width=6, out.width=&quot;100%&quot;}
plot(1:10)
```</code></pre>
<p>Thatâ€™s all! I hope this helps.</p>
