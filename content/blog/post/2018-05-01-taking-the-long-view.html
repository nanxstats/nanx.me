<p>The world is a fast-changing place. Eleven years ago, when iPhone was
first launched, people probably didn’t anticipate that was the end of Nokia.
Today, I don’t even use the voice calling feature on my phone anymore,
unless really necessary. This might not be good news for AT&amp;T, and maybe
I’m an outlier, but this is the truth, this is the world we live.</p>
<p>After walking a long road in such a changing world, it is easy to
forget why we started at first. For example, we judge things by
their <em>values</em>, instead of their <em>merits</em>, and make short-term decisions.
Sometimes, when consciously realizing that I’m losing directions,
I would rewatch this documentary about a mathematician:
<em>Taking the Long View: The Life of Shiing-shen Chern</em>.
Here is a short, digested version.</p>

<p>In the full version of the film, among many good interviews, there was
an interesting description of Chern’s pure, dignified lifestyle of choice:</p>
<blockquote>
His routine was to get up, have a cup of tea, do his math. Have another
cup of tea, then do his math. Have lunch, take a nap, have a cup of tea,
and do his math…
</blockquote>
<p>This might sound pretty idealistic, but I guess it reflects Chern’s love of
the career he devoted to, his purely spiritual pursue of mathematics —
for math itself, and not for anything else.</p>
<p>He peacefully worked with the world, while did not lose himself in the world.
I think that is an admirable lifetime achievement.</p>
