<p>Technology companies are sometimes quirky but always quite interesting.</p>
<p>Often, we can witness accidental epic wins in products that don’t belong to a company’s main offerings. A few examples from the (almost) trillion dollar club:</p>
<p>Microsoft is a software company, but they have made some excellent hardware products, especially accessories. Recently, they even <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2018/06/29/iconic-mouse-that-changed-how-we-use-the-internet-is-relaunched-by-microsoft/">remastered the legendary IntelliMouse</a>, an ergonomic mouse designed for office use but highly acclaimed in the gaming community.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, Apple is a hardware company, while their operating system is beautifully done (though the quality is declining) with superb GUI software innovations. People even want to run it on PC, a.k.a., the “Hackintosh”.</p>
<p>As our last example, Amazon is a B2C company with a traditional business model: selling stuff online. It has become evident that their <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-of-amazons-2017-operating-income-comes-from-aws/">cash cow and growth driving product</a>, at least for a long time, will be the well-known public cloud service: AWS.</p>
<p>I believe the lesson here is simple: 1. respect the market and acknowledge our own ignorance. 2. Try new things bravely but plan ahead. 3. Repeat 1 and 2 regularly.</p>
