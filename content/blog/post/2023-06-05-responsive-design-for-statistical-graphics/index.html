  Explore the new approach to adaptive visualizations using responsive
  statistical graphics with Shiny and ggplot2.
  This post breaks down the process of creating statistical graphics that
  dynamically adapt to various screen sizes, transforming how data is
  visualized and consumed. Discover the nuances of fitting responsive
  graphics into responsive containers and optimizing layout behaviors.

<p>If you have written any Shiny apps, you are probably familiar with the idea of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a>,
which focuses on web page layouts adaptive to screen size and popularized by
the front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap.</p>
<p>Could the similar idea be applied to statistical graphics?
In my opinion, the answer is yes, and the idea can be helpful for arranging
multi-panel graphics under the context of creating effective visualizations
that are adaptive to any screen sizes.</p>
<div id="starter-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Starter example</h2>
<p>It is straightforward to demonstrate the idea of
<strong>responsive statistical graphics</strong> with ggplot2 and Shiny.
The key steps are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In Shiny, get the current plot output width and height detected in the
web browser using the session API provided by
<a href="https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/client-data/"><code>session$clientData</code></a>.</li>
<li>In ggplot2, use the width data to decide the grid layout (number of columns)
and graphical details such as font size of the multi-facet plot.</li>
<li>Save the output with proper pixel width and height using an appropriate graphical device.</li>
<li>In Shiny, re-render the plot based on screen size changes using <code>shiny::renderImage()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following this logic, we can write a minimal prototype with 30 lines of R code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;shiny&quot;)
library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)

ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  plotOutput(&quot;plot_responsive&quot;)
)

server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot_responsive &lt;- renderImage(
    {
      width &lt;- session$clientData$output_plot_responsive_width
      height &lt;- session$clientData$output_plot_responsive_height

      outfile &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.png&quot;)

      png(outfile, width = width * 3, height = height * 3, res = 300)
      p &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()
      i &lt;- findInterval(width, c(540, 720, 960, 1140, 1320)) + 1
      p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8)[i])
      print(p)
      dev.off()

      list(src = outfile, width = width, height = height)
    },
    deleteFile = TRUE
  )
}

shinyApp(ui, server)</code></pre>
<p>For the purpose of displaying information in a more interpretable way,
it might be a good idea to fix the aspect ratio of each panel or for
single-facet displays. There is also previous research suggesting the optimal
display ratio such as the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2288843">45° banking rule by Cleveland et al. (1988)</a>.</p>

<div id="responsive-graphics-within-responsive-containers" class="section level2">
<h2>Responsive graphics within responsive containers</h2>
<p>Of course, we can extend the idea of responsive graphics and fit them inside
a multi-column responsive page layout.
This <a href="https://gist.github.com/nanxstats/59e91cc32548c1522ebff55ef6facd20">GitHub Gist</a>
has a more generic implementation with modularized plotting and saving functions
to show both single-column and two-column layouts with vector-based
SVG output.</p>

</div>
<p>The multi-column layout case is even more intriguing because unlike the
single-column case, this is a “responsive graphics within responsive containers”
situation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Image output width is not equal to the screen size anymore, and the default
output width could be much smaller than the single-column case.</li>
<li>Image output width is not monotonic to screen size anymore because the
responsive layout effect of the Bootstrap fluid containers will also kick in:
columns can be rearranged to the next fluid row as screen size decreases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, if we want to keep the graphics to have consistent responsive layout
behaviors, more deliberate calculations and parameter settings might be required.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-technical-note-on-interval-finding" class="section level2">
<h2>A technical note on interval finding</h2>
<p>The reactive layout computation requires finding where the current plot width
falls in consecutive intervals of container sizes.
To achieve this, my original prototype implementation included many tedious
<code>if</code> constructs.</p>
<p>In fact, there are much better ways to handle such interval finding problems
in R: the <code>findInterval()</code> function can simplify the logic into one function
call. For fewer breaking points, you can also use a fancy approach with
upcasting, for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>i &lt;- (width &gt;= 960) + (width &gt;= 1140) + 1
p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = c(1, 2, 4)[i])</code></pre>
<p>These tricks were taken from an online <a href="https://d.cosx.org/d/423852/5">discussion</a>
(thanks, <a href="https://yihui.org/"><span class="citation">@yihui</span></a>).</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, you can create a generic responsive plotting framework to automate
all the fine details discussed above!
Please kindly let me know if you or someone else has already done this
as I would love to try it out.</p>
