<p>TL;DR: Please help me extend this GitHub repo by adding your own
base R programming idioms:

<p>For a long time, I’ve told people that I am not an R expert. I don’t know
too much about R. I just happen to write software that encounters the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance">least resistance</a>
when implemented in R. I’m shy. I’d rather solve problems myself than ask.
StackOverflow is my best friend.
Every day, as I learn more about R, I realize that there’s a lot I don’t know.
The things I’ve forgotten balance out with the new stuff I learn.</p>
<p>I’m still all those things today. What can I do to help myself out?</p>
<p>About twelve years ago, I started to answer R questions on
<a href="https://d.cosx.org/">Capital of Statistics</a>, an online community.
I didn’t always know the answers, but the research process helped me
understand what “idiomatic R code” looks like.
I uncovered patterns, tricks, and constructs that I never
could have imagined existed.</p>
<p>I loved the discussions. I can’t say how many questions I answered or
participated in total, but one day, I realized I could answer most questions
confidently. Ironically, it was at this point when I realized I no longer
had the time to participate in these exchanges. Such is adulthood, I suppose.
I took a break, focused on other things in life.
So many amazing things happened after that: the rise of the tidyverse in R,
the Python data stack, and deep learning.</p>
<p>Today, as I dive deeper into new tech stacks, I find myself cherishing the
foundational knowledge of base R I’ve gained over the years even more.
As a result, I’ve decided to launch this GitHub repository:
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/r-base-shortcuts">r-base-shortcuts</a>.
This project compiles practical solutions for base R coding challenges,
distilled from recurring patterns in frequently asked questions—especially
those requiring thoughtful consideration and prior experience to solve.</p>
<p>I believe this collection of base R idioms and shortcuts can help you write
concise, idiomatic, and fast R code. It could also be a valuable resource
for training or interview preparation. My hope is that this collection will
help flatten your learning curve, letting you enjoy solving common
base R programming problems and writing ergonomic R code.</p>
