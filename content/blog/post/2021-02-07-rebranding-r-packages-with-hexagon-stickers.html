</div>
<p>I have built <a href="https://nanx.me/software/">a few R packages</a> over the years.
I have always been adding some forms of an ad hoc logo to them, trying to
make a visual impression. As the portfolio size gets larger, I realized
that I would need a principled way to create the logos and refresh my
packages’ look. Hexagon stickers seem to be an acceptable form
of logos that are <a href="https://github.com/search?q=hex+sticker">heavily used</a>
by the R community. So I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Limited by the fact that I am not a professional graphic designer while still
trying to do it myself, I set two goals:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Show strong visual consistency across the board, but also display clear
hierarchy and variation.</li>
<li>Create any future stickers without thinking. Ideally, I should be able to
make a new sticker in under a minute.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these parameters, my plan looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>. The sticker will be text-only and not contain any subplots.</li>
<li><strong>Typography</strong>. Use a consistent
<a href="https://fuckyeahtypefacedesign.tumblr.com/post/42119630673/so-you-draw-fonts-anonymously-submitted">typeface</a> for the package names. Zilla Slab at weight 500 is my choice
as it has a sturdy feel and more details than a sans serif.
Adjust the size as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Color</strong>. Since trying to find any (new) color combinations that work well
will add extra work, I simplified things a bit. I use beige as the fill color,
with the text and the sticker border sharing the same color. This color is decided by
the category of the package and comes from a single color palette.
I selected a low-saturated, pastel color palette
<a href="https://color.adobe.com/Kopia-vintage-card-color-theme-11990015/">Kopia vintage card</a>
to convey a mild, sophisticated message.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The rest is easy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write the R code. There might be a lack of convention on where to put the code.
I chose to use <code>inst/logo/logo.R</code> to match the image name.</li>
<li>Generate the hex sticker image. It is placed as <code>man/figures/logo.png</code>.
This follows the guidelines in
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Figures">Writing R extensions</a>
and makes roxygen2 and pkgdown happy.</li>
<li>Link the sticker in the <code>README.md</code> title. The wonderful <code>usethis::use_logo()</code>
helps this process when the logo is ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the R script for generating the hex stickers is quite simple, thanks to
the incredible authors of sysfonts, hexSticker, and magick.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sysfonts::font_add_google(&quot;Zilla Slab&quot;, &quot;pf&quot;, regular.wt = 500)

hexSticker::sticker(
  subplot = ~ plot.new(), s_x = 1, s_y = 1, s_width = 0.1, s_height = 0.1,
  package = &quot;pkgname&quot;, p_x = 1, p_y = 1, p_size = 8, h_size = 1.2, p_family = &quot;pf&quot;,
  p_color = &quot;#3F8CCC&quot;, h_fill = &quot;#FFF9F2&quot;, h_color = &quot;#3F8CCC&quot;,
  dpi = 320, filename = &quot;man/figures/logo.png&quot;
)

magick::image_read(&quot;man/figures/logo.png&quot;)

rstudioapi::restartSession()</code></pre>
<p>That’s all, folks.</p>
