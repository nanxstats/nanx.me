<p>I once read a joke with some dry humor a long time ago. It’s almost a parable about how the system amplifies fragility. I’m not entirely sure where it originated, but here you go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bunny bounced into a bakery and asked the baker: “do you have 100 croissants?”</p>
<p>The baker: “Ahh, I’m so sorry we don’t have that many.”</p>
<p>The bunny: “Oh… okay.” The bunny left disappointed.</p>
<p>On the second day, the bunny bounced into the bakery: “do you have 100 croissants?”</p>
<p>The baker: “I’m sorry we still don’t have that…”</p>
<p>The bunny left disappointed again.</p>
<p>On the third day, the bunny bounced into the bakery: do you have 100 croissants?</p>
<p>The baker: “Yes! Yes! We’ve got 100 croissants today!”</p>
<p>The bunny: “That’s perfect! I’ll take two.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill Gates may <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital">think</a> that the supply and demand model doesn’t apply to software. I neither agree or disagree. Historically, the burst of the dot-com bubble left us some infrastructure of the high-speed Internet. The subprime mortgage crisis left some cheap houses. I cannot say for sure what will be left when a crisis happens to the “blockchain” or “AI” industries. Although there could be a lot of Mac computers, Dell monitors, and Python code.</p>
