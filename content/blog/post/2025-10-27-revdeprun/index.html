<p>I’m glad to announce the release of
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/revdeprun">revdeprun</a>, a Rust CLI tool that makes
it easy to run reverse dependency checks on cloud instances<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If you maintain an R package with many reverse dependencies, you’ll know that
revdep checking can be time-consuming and requires significant computational
resources. revdeprun aims to make this process as painless as possible by
automating the entire workflow in a single command.</p>
<p>You can install revdeprun from crates.io using Cargo:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cargo install revdeprun</code></pre>
<p>Then, running a full reverse dependency check is as simple as:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>revdeprun https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically set up R, configure your environment, clone your package,
and run <code>revdepcheck::revdep_check()</code> with all the sensible defaults.
The <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/revdeprun">README</a> provides more details about
installation and usage.</p>
<div id="why-reverse-dependency-checking-matters" class="section level2">
<h2>Why reverse dependency checking matters</h2>
<p>If you’ve been lucky enough to have other R package authors depend on your work,
you’ll eventually need to think about reverse dependency checking.
The idea is simple but important: before you release a new version of your package,
you want to make sure that your changes don’t break any of the packages that
depend on you. It’s like integration testing, but at the CRAN ecosystem level.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#sec-release-revdep-checks">R Packages book</a>
has a nice explanation of the overall workflow, and there are several excellent
tools in R for running these checks locally:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck"><code>revdepcheck</code></a> from r-lib</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yihui/crandalf"><code>crandalf</code></a> and <code>xfun::rev_check()</code> from Yihui Xie</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/revdepcheck.extras"><code>revdepcheck.extras</code></a> from Henrik Bengtsson</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools work great when you have a handful of reverse dependencies,
but things get trickier as that number grows.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-challenge-of-scale" class="section level2">
<h2>The challenge of scale</h2>
<p>The trouble starts when you have many reverse dependencies.
Reverse dependency checking is an embarrassingly parallel, CPU-bound task:
each package can be checked independently, and more CPU cores mean faster results.</p>
<p>If you’re maintaining a popular package with 100+ reverse dependencies,
even a maxed out desktop setup with 32 threads<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> won’t be fast enough.
You really need to move to the cloud, where you can spin up instances
with 128+ vCPUs on demand.</p>
<p>But there is another reason to use cloud instances: security.
Running reverse dependency checks means executing third-party code
that you probably shouldn’t fully trust. Using disposable cloud instances
gives you a clean environment that you can throw away when you’re done.</p>
<p>The catch is that setting up these throwaway instances is tedious.
You need to install R, configure package repositories, set up the right
environment variables, and handle a bunch of other running context details<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This manual setup gets old fast when you’re spinning up instances regularly.
That’s the gap that revdeprun fills: it handles all the provisioning and
configuration automatically, so you can focus on reviewing the actual results.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-rust" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Rust?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why this is a Rust CLI tool rather than an R package,
a Python package or a simple shell script. The answer comes down to the
constraints of the problem: when you’re paying for cloud compute by the minute,
you want everything to work smoothly on the first try, with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p>Rust fits this niche well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better than a shell script</strong>: Rust gives you proper error handling,
better testing, and easier distribution. It also has better cross-platform
potential if we want to support Windows or macOS in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easier than R or Python</strong>: To use R or Python to set up R itself
feels circular. We’d need to set up the language runtime first,
which is exactly what we’re trying to automate. With Rust, you can distribute
a single static executable that just works.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, the core revdep checking recipe is still written in R:
see it in <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/revdeprun/blob/main/src/revdep.rs"><code>revdep.rs</code></a>.
The Rust tool is really just a wrapper that orchestrates
the setup and execution.</p>
