<p>For a long time, I have been maintaining my homepage and the portfolio pages
(software, papers) with HTML purely written by hand.
<a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> was my frontend framework for about
five years, then I switched to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>
this year.</p>
<p>After I (re)-started blogging at the end of last year, things got a bit
complicated. The blog and the portfolio pages don’t get a consistent look
(the blog looks cooler…). What’s worse, they are maintained separately:
one was generated by software automatically, and the other one was painfully
updated by hand. Things have to change.</p>
<p>Today, I can finally announce that I have proudly gone full blogdown!
Right now, all the pages on the surface of this website are
entirely generated by blogdown. The migration and merging
of the two sources took about 24 hours.</p>
<p>To make the transition easier, I built a new Hugo/blogdown theme that allows me
to write HTML to use Bootstrap 4 components for specific pages,
and write Markdown for the less complicated pages, such as the blog.
This theme is named as <strong>Renga</strong> (連歌, linked poem). See more
screenshots in its <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga">GitHub repo</a>.
Here is a <a href="https://nanx.me/hugo-renga/">live preview site</a>.</p>

<p>OK, now we have both <a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/hugo-tanka-theme/">Tanka</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga">Renga</a>,
I’m wondering how Haiku looks. Stay tuned folks.</p>
