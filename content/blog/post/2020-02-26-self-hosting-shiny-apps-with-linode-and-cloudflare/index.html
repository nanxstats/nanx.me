description: The motivation and setup to self-host my shiny apps with Linode and Cloudflare.

<p>After procrastinating for some time, I finally set up a dedicated self-hosting server, <a href="https://nanx.app">nanx.app</a>, for my public shiny apps. From now on, most of the web applications listed on <a href="https://nanx.me/software/">my software page</a> will be available from two mirrors — the self-hosting server and the public cloud hosting solution <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> kindly provided by Posit.</p>

<div id="the-motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>The Motivation</h2>
<p>I have built many shiny apps over the years — a few of them are public and open source. As a fully managed solution, shinyapps.io has provided a handy and flexible enough hosting venue for 95% of the apps I built.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always rainbows and butterflies, though. Sometimes, I feel I still need extra flexibility and control over the system environments, especially when we can now use the incredible <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a> to call Python modules directly. One example is my recent app <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/cwl-upgrader">cwl-upgrader</a>, where the dependency could not be easily installed and discovered by the correct version of Python (if any) on shinyapps.io. To host this app, I decided to set up my own server.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main technical reasons to create a self-hosting server may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better technical flexibility.
<ul>
<li>Install and use any “non-standard” dependencies.</li>
<li>Explore new web frameworks such as <a href="https://twitter.com/nanxstats/status/1155992482993205251">Dash for R</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/fiery">Fiery</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better personal branding.
<ul>
<li>All apps are accessible under a single, personalized domain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better pricing model.
<ul>
<li>Switch from time usage-based pricing to traffic-based pricing (harder to exhaust for me).</li>
<li>HTTPS for the custom domain with no nominal cost.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>In brief, it looks like this:</p>

<p>Cloudflare handles the SSL, CDN, traffic scrubbing tasks, which simplifies things a lot. I used Linode for the cloud hosting part, but you can use any other vendors. I find these tutorials most useful during the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/set-up-and-secure/">How to secure your server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-cloudflare-with-linode/">How to set up Cloudflare with Linode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/213733868-Running-Shiny-Server-with-a-Proxy">Running Shiny Server with a proxy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time to figure out every detail when setting things up (DevOps can be intimidating), but one can often get it done after a little research. For example, two ops related issues I encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>When uploading “large” files under the default Nginx settings, it returned a “413 Request Entity Too Large” error. We can usually set the <code>client_max_body_size</code> in <code>nginx.conf</code> to resolve this issue.</li>
<li>On the $5/month 1GB RAM node I used, <a href="https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen/issues/53">compiling some particular dependencies</a> can max out the memory. I just temporarily resized the node to a bigger RAM node to compile them, and then resized back.</li>
</ul>
