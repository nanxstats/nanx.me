<p>I used to mention creating a purely R-based static website generator named Haiku
with my then classmate <a href="https://aabiddanda.github.io/">Arjun</a> about two years ago.
I remember that he said the name was nice.</p>
<p>Time flies, and apparently, I did not have the chance to build it.
Fortunately, <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui</a> saved the world again, and now
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> has become the most elegant
and powerful static website generator for R users,
especially if you love R Markdown.</p>
<p>Without a hesitation, I decided to revive my blog and build a minimalist theme for it.
Based on David’s awesome <a href="https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/hugo-black-and-light-theme">Black &amp; Light</a> theme,
I made some of my own improvements and built this Hugo theme named
<a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-tanka">Tanka</a> for blogdown and Hugo users.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>It is straightforward to create your blogdown website and try out the
Tanka theme in RStudio. Simply click <code>File</code> → <code>New Project</code> →
<code>New Directory</code> → <code>Website using blogdown</code>, then fill the “Hugo theme”
field with <code>nanxstats/hugo-tanka</code>.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for this theme. Enjoy!</p>
