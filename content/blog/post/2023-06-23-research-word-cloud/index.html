  Create engaging word cloud visualizations from your research papers with this
  automated workflow. This post guides you through collecting text data,
  extracting top words using Python, refining the word list, generating and
  fine-tuning the word cloud, and converting it to PDF/PNG files. Ideal for
  researchers seeking an aesthetically pleasing way to showcase their work.

<p>Many outstanding researchers and labs have created visualizations of their
research using word clouds. In this post, I present a simple, automated
“paper2wordcloud” workflow to create eye-catching word cloud visualizations.
It combines the efficiency of automation with the power of human intuition
and aesthetic sense. The figure below was created using
<a href="https://nanx.me/papers/">my published papers</a>.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="/image/wordcloud.png" alt="A word cloud visualization generated for my papers using this workflow." />
<div class="figcaption">A word cloud visualization generated for my papers using this workflow.</div>
</div>
<p>The general steps in the workflow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect PDF files representing your research (10 min).</li>
<li>Run a Python script to extract the top words from the PDF files (10 min).</li>
<li>Review, edit, and finalize the list of top words (20 min).</li>
<li>Use a word cloud generator, adjust the look, and generate SVG (15 min).</li>
<li>Convert the SVG file to a PDF/PNG file (5 min).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s dive into it.</p>
<div id="workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>Workflow</h2>
<div id="step-1-collect-your-research" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: Collect your research</h3>
<p>Collect all the PDF files that can represent your research, for example,
papers, slides, posters, and proposals. Place all PDF files in a single,
flat directory, without subfolders.
The PDF files should be machine-readable, that is, the pages should not be
scanned photocopies, and the text should be selectable in PDF viewers.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-extract-top-words" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Extract top words</h3>
<div id="install-python" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1 Install Python</h4>
<p>Install Python if you haven’t. For macOS users, install
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python">Python via Homebrew</a>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>brew install python</code></pre>
<p>This will install the latest maintained release of Python 3 provided by Homebrew.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-text-processing-script-and-install-dependency" class="section level4">
<h4>2.2 Get text processing script and install dependency</h4>
<p>Clone this GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/pdf-word-extraction">nanxstats/pdf-word-extraction</a>.
It contains a Python script I wrote for extracting meaningful words,
as defined by a statistical model, from the PDF files.</p>
<p>Follow the workflow section in the repo readme to create a virtual environment
in the cloned repository, activate it, and install the required Python packages
into the virtual environment. This includes pypdf for PDF parsing,
ftfy for text cleaning, and spaCy for natural language processing.</p>
<p>Everything below assumes you are in the directory with the
virtual environment activated.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-the-script" class="section level4">
<h4>2.3 Run the script</h4>
<p>Now, copy all the PDF files prepared in step 1 into <code>pdf/</code>.</p>
<p>Then, run the Python script:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>python3 pdf_word_extraction.py</code></pre>
<p>This will print the top 250 words and their frequencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="step-3-review-edit-and-finalize-top-words" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 3: Review, edit, and finalize top words</h3>
<p>Review the output and identify any words that should be removed or replaced.
The common reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Removal</strong>: Words that are meaningful in general but not meaningful
in your research context should be removed. Examples include
“journal”, “conference”, “Figure”, “Table”, and author names.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replacement</strong>: Uncommon proper nouns that should be stylized in a
specific way can be fixed via replacement. The frequency counts for
plural and singular forms of the same word can be merged via replacement, too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To add word removal or replacement rules, open <code>pdf_word_extraction.py</code>.
Edit the entries in the list <code>words_to_remove</code> and the key-value pairs in the
dictionary <code>replacements</code>. Save and run the Python script again with the same command as before:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>python3 pdf_word_extraction.py</code></pre>
<p>Check the output again. Since some words in the original output have now been
removed or replaced, the words newly popped into the list might give you more
words to remove or replace. Continue this review-edit-run cycle until the
top 250 words looks perfect. For me, I ended up removing 50 words and
establishing 12 replacement rules.</p>
<p>Each time after running the script, a <code>top_words.txt</code> will be generated or
overwritten under the directory. We will use this file in the next step.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-4-use-the-word-cloud-generator" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 4: Use the word cloud generator</h3>
<p>Open <code>top_words.txt</code>, select all content, copy and paste into the
<a href="https://nanx.me/wordcloud/">word cloud generator</a> described in my previous
<a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/rethinking-word-cloud-generator/">blog post</a>,
then click the “Refresh Word Cloud” button to generate an initial layout.</p>
<p>Adjust the graphical parameters based on your aesthetic preferences.
Key parameters to consider include the color palette, font,
scale transformation method, and the number of words to display.</p>
<p>Keep clicking the “Refresh Word Cloud” button until you achieve a layout
you are satisfied with. Personally, I prefer a layout where all the
major words are displayed horizontally. Click the “Download SVG” button
to save the word cloud as an SVG file.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-5-convert-word-cloud-to-a-pdfpng-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 5: Convert word cloud to a PDF/PNG file</h3>
<p>See the appendix section of my previous
<a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/rethinking-word-cloud-generator/">blog post</a>
for a robust command-line workflow to convert the SVG file into a vector
PDF file or a 300 DPI PNG file.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>With these steps, you now have a professional word cloud visualization
based on your research. Enjoy exploring your data in this visually
engaging format!</p>
<p>This “paper2wordcloud” workflow demonstrates how to use Python to
automate a seemingly difficult task that involves processing natural language
data, while allows incorporating human knowledge and preferences.
I’m quite amazed by how the text data processing toolchain in Python has
advanced, making it a perfect choice for tasks like this.</p>
