<p>I attended <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/">PyCon US 2025</a> in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania from May 16–18, 2025. As my first Python conference,
I wanted to document the most interesting things I learned.</p>
<div id="why-a-statistician-goes-to-pycon" class="section level2">
<h2>Why a statistician goes to PyCon?</h2>
<p>It might seem odd for a statistician to focus on any particular programming
language. But I’m not your typical statistician.
As <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/OtherDocs/Haskell.html">Dijkstra said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not only the violin that shapes the violinist, we are all shaped by
the tools we train ourselves to use, and in this respect programming languages
have a devious influence: they shape our thinking habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to understand how different technical communities think,
we need to engage with their latest progress through experiences like this.
In particular, Python has become the primary language for generative AI—a
field driven by efficiently processing huge amounts of unlabeled data
rather than theoretical advances. This approach has shown some different wisdom
from traditional statistical thinking, so I was curious to see how the
language enables better technical and business outcomes in future AI
(and AGI!) applications.</p>

<div id="there-were-so-many-interesting-talks" class="section level2">
<h2>There were so many interesting talks</h2>
<p>I focused on talks about speed, safety, and code quality.
Here are the most informative ones for me.</p>
<div id="free-threaded-cpython" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Free-threaded CPython</h3>
<p>With Python 3.13t, free-threading (NoGIL) moved from concept to reality.
The <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/">Python free-threading guide</a> serves
as a helpful community resource. Importantly, free-threading helps with
I/O-intensive tasks, not CPU-intensive ones. Notable talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building a NoGIL load balancer in 30 minutes</strong><br />
Alvaro Duran,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/113/">Abstract</a></li>
<li><strong>Using Rust in free-threaded vs regular Python 3.13</strong><br />
David Hewitt,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/110/">Abstract</a></li>
<li><strong>Unraveling community support For free-threaded Python</strong><br />
Lysandros Nikolaou and Nathan Goldbaum,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/42/">Abstract</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gpu-computing" class="section level3">
<h3>2. GPU computing</h3>
<p>Five years ago, I was skeptical about GPU-accelerated computing despite
the promises of deep learning. Now I see it as the only practical path to scale.
Shaping your problem-solving around high-throughput floating-point computation
is a shortcut to success.</p>
<p>These talks introduced me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model">roofline
model</a> for visualizing GPU kernel
performance. The second talk was particularly exciting. It covered Python-level
innovations that could reduce the need for CUDA C++ through
<a href="https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/python/cooperative_api.html">cuda.cooperative</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When GPUs make Python slower: patterns and pitfalls</strong><br />
Kaashif Hymabaccus,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/138/">Abstract</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfXfj29KhLo">Recording</a></li>
<li><strong>GPU programming in pure Python</strong><br />
Bryce Adelstein Lelbach,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/111/">Abstract</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8utSRblGEB0">Recording</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="metaprogramming-and-jit-compilation" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Metaprogramming and JIT compilation</h3>
<p>These topics can enable syntax sugars that help developers write correct,
concise, and fast Python code. While I’m not a programming language
expert and missed some details, it’s always valuable to know what’s out there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supercharge your Python library using AST parsing</strong><br />
Adam Glustein,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/129/">Abstract</a></li>
<li><strong>What they don’t tell you about building a JIT compiler for CPython</strong><br />
Brandt Bucher,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/5/">Abstract</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE-Oq8I3X_w">Recording</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="design-and-testing-best-practices" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Design and testing best practices</h3>
<p>These were some of my favorite talks. While not cutting-edge technology,
they offered valuable perspectives on engineering practices and
avoiding common pitfalls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design pressure: The invisible hand that shapes your code</strong><br />
Hynek Schlawack,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/81/">Abstract</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNSINolcSM">Recording</a></li>
<li><strong>Notes, Groups and Stars: exceptional new features of Python 3.11!</strong><br />
Zac Hatfield-Dodds,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/96/">Abstract</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5WdMYfsxnQ">Recording</a></li>
<li><strong>Who tests the testers? Making and testing pipelines</strong><br />
Evan Kohilas,
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/28/">Abstract</a>,

<div id="reconnecting-with-friends" class="section level2">
<h2>Reconnecting with friends</h2>
<p>The highlight of my Pittsburgh trip was meeting my friend
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svzbioshock/">Simo</a> in person for the first time
in seven years. I was excited to learn he has completed the
<a href="https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/cse234-w25/">UCSD CSE 234</a> and
<a href="https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2024-fall-65940">MIT 6.5940</a> courses
I recommended for understanding the computational innovations behind LLMs.
He also recommended <a href="https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall24">Stanford CS149</a>
to me for learning GPU parallel computing fundamentals.
Simo has been building his own neural network framework
<a href="https://github.com/svm-zhang/nn_from_scratch">nn-from-scratch</a> and
Transformers library.</p>
<p>We covered way too many topics—Neovim, uv, Rust, matmul, cuTile,
tinygrad, PagedAttention… and PyCon provided the perfect break from
our busy daily routines.</p>
