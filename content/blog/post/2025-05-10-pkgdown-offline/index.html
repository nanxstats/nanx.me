  Introducing pkgdown.offline, an R package for building pkgdown websites
  entirely offline. Learn how it addresses recent pkgdown internet requirements,
  essential for CI/CD pipelines and air-gapped environments.

<p>I’m pleased to announce that the R package
<a href="https://nanx.me/pkgdown.offline/">pkgdown.offline</a> is now available on CRAN.
You can install it with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;pkgdown.offline&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>pkgdown.offline enables you to build <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a>
websites in environments without internet access, such as private, restricted
development workflows or CI/CD pipelines. It achieves this by bundling the
essential frontend assets (CSS, JavaScript) that pkgdown typically fetches
online and by providing alternative implementations for key pkgdown functions
like <code>init_site()</code> and <code>build_site()</code>.</p>
<div id="the-need-for-an-offline-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>The need for an offline solution</h2>
<p>Previously, setting <code>options(pkgdown.internet = FALSE)</code> was sufficient for
offline pkgdown builds (since pkgdown 1.2.0, November 2018). However, this
functionality stopped to work effectively with pkgdown 2.1.0 (July 2024)
and was formally deprecated in pkgdown 2.1.2 (released April 2025).</p>
<p>This change presents a challenge for users in air-gapped computing environments,
as attempting to build pkgdown sites will fail directly without any built-in
options to bypass the internet requirement.
After observing this recurring issue and initially suggesting workarounds
like using older pkgdown versions, I developed pkgdown.offline to provide
a more robust and forward-looking solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-pkgdown.offline-works" class="section level2">
<h2>How pkgdown.offline works</h2>
<p>pkgdown.offline uses a few key strategies to achieve reliable offline builds
while optimizing package size.</p>
<p><strong>1. Minified local asset cache</strong></p>
<p>A primary reason for pkgdown deprecating its offline build feature was the
challenge of bundling and maintaining frontend assets. pkgdown.offline
solves this by including these assets. To keep the package size minimal
(well under CRAN’s 5MB limit) and support multiple pkgdown versions,
a maintenance script deduplicates cached assets using file checksums.
The initial release of pkgdown.offline is only about 600KB.
At runtime, the package uses a map generated during the deduplication step
to restore the necessary files to their expected locations.</p>
<p><strong>2. Monkey patching core functions</strong></p>
<p>With the <code>pkgdown.internet</code> option removed, some internal pkgdown functions
now assume internet connectivity. pkgdown.offline provides wrappers for
critical functions like <code>pkgdown::init_site()</code> and <code>pkgdown::build_site()</code>.
These wrappers dynamically modify (or “monkey patch”) relevant internal pkgdown
functions at runtime to prevent them from attempting to connect to the internet.
This approach is similar to the <a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/testthat-snapshot-monkey-patch/">testthat snapshot location
customization method</a>
I have described previously.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lifecycle management</strong></p>
<p>pkgdown.offline is designed to support pkgdown versions 2.1.0 and newer.
With each new release of pkgdown on CRAN, pkgdown.offline will be verified and,
if necessary, updated to ensure continued compatibility.
Based on pkgdown’s historical release pattern, this maintenance is expected
to be manageable. Details on the update procedure are documented in the
<a href="https://nanx.me/pkgdown.offline/articles/update.html">update pkgdown.offline vignette</a>.</p>
