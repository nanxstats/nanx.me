I'm a statistician in [Methodology Research](https://jobs.merck.com/bards),
led by [Keaven M. Anderson](https://keaven.github.io/),
at [Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA](https://www.merck.com/).
I work on problems at the intersection of statistical methodology and
research software engineering.
My focus is on building software infrastructure that makes late-stage
clinical development efficient and reliable.

I serve on the [R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://r-consortium.org/about/governance.html)
and contribute to the [R Submissions Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/),
which pioneered the first successful open source R submission pilot to the FDA.
I'm a regular contributor to [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/),
an ecosystem of open source tools for clinical reporting.

My research interests include sparse linear models, representation learning,
and developer tooling. I build [software](/software/) in R, Python, and Rust.
Projects I maintain include
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/),
[pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/),
[rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/),
[tinytopics](https://nanx.me/tinytopics/),
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
and [revdeprun](https://nanx.me/revdeprun/).

Previously, I was a data scientist at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/)
in Boston, building genomics platforms.
I studied human genetics in [Matthew Stephens lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
at the University of Chicago.
I have a Ph.D. in Statistics from Central South University,
where I developed machine learning methods for high-dimensional data
with [Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
