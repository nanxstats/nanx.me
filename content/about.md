I am a statistician from [Merck & Co.](https://www.merck.com/)
I work in the Methodology Research group led by
[Keaven M. Anderson](https://keaven.github.io/)
in the [Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences](https://jobs.merck.com/bards) (BARDS) department.
I currently serve on the R Consortium
[Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/governance)
as a representative of Merck & Co., as well as on the
[R Submissions Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/).

In my daily work, I solve challenges at the intersection of
statistical methodology research and software architecture innovation.
My research interests include sparse linear models,
representation learning, and computational reproducibility.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) in R.
My favorites include
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/),
[liftr](https://liftr.me/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/),
and
[pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at
[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/)
(now acquired by Summa Equity) in Boston, MA.
Earlier in my career, I studied [human genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) in
[Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
at the University of Chicago.
I earned my Ph.D. degree in statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for
high-dimensional data analysis, advised by
[Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
