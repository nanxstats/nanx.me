I am a statistician at [Merck & Co., Inc.](https://www.merck.com/),
Rahway, NJ, USA.
I am part of the Methodology Research group led by
[Keaven M. Anderson](https://keaven.github.io/) within
[Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences](https://jobs.merck.com/bards)
(BARDS).
I also represent our company on the [R Consortium
Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://r-consortium.org/about/governance.html)
and contribute to the
[R Submissions Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/).

In my daily work, I solve challenges at the intersection of
statistical methodology research and software architecture innovation.
My research interests include sparse linear models,
representation learning, and computational reproducibility.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) in R and Python.
My favorites include
[tinytopics](https://nanx.me/tinytopics/),
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/),
and
[pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at
[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/)
(now acquired by Summa Equity) in Boston, MA.
Earlier in my career, I studied [human genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) in
[Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
at the University of Chicago.
I earned my Ph.D. degree in statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for
high-dimensional data analysis, advised by
[Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
