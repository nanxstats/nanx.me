I am a statistician at [Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA](https://www.merck.com/)
in [Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences (BARDS)](https://jobs.merck.com/bards),
Methodology Research, led by [Keaven M. Anderson](https://keaven.github.io/).
I also contribute to cross-industry initiatives including the
[R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee](https://r-consortium.org/about/governance.html),
[R Submissions Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/),
and [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/).

My work sits at the intersection of statistical methodology and
research software engineering. Interests include sparse linear models,
representation learning, and computational reproducibility.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) in R, Python, TypeScript, and Rust;
selected projects include
[tinytopics](https://nanx.me/tinytopics/),
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/),
[pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/), and
[py-pkglite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/py-pkglite/).

Previously, I was a data scientist at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/)
(now acquired by Summa Equity) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Earlier, I studied [human genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/)
in [Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) at the
University of Chicago.
I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics from Central South University, China,
where I developed statistical machine learning methods for
high-dimensional data under the supervision of
[Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
