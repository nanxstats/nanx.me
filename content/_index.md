I'm a statistician working on clinical development and research software
engineering at [Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA](https://www.merck.com/).

My work shapes how statistical methods become reliable software,
and how that software clears regulatory review with transparency
and reproducibility, in high-stakes clinical settings worldwide.

I care about building software infrastructure that scales:
infrastructure for electronic submissions and developer workflows that
make effective collaboration possible across teams and companies.
I maintain [software](/software/) in R, Python, and Rust.
