Hi! I'm **Nan Xiao**, a senior data scientist working at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/). I have a PhD degree in statistics. My [research](https://nanx.me/papers/) has focused on developing statistical machine learning methods to analyze high-dimensional data. My [Erd≈ës number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576) is 4.

I'm interested in discovering the connections between things. I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my computational workflow in statistics and translational bioinformatics. My favorite works include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/), [stackgbm](https://nanx.me/stackgbm/), [oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/), [liftr](https://liftr.me/), and [ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/).

I currently live in Cambridge, MA. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing squash and running along the [Charles River](https://twitter.com/nanxstats/status/1168690124051423232/).
