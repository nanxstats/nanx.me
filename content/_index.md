Hi! I'm Nan---a statistician by training, a software builder at heart.
I build and ship statistical and research software where dependable
engineering meets intuitive design.
I work across clinical research, machine learning, and open source tooling,
turning real-world constraints into systems that are reliable, accessible,
and maintainable.
My commitment to software extends to developer experience.
I design plaintext workflows that teams can adopt and extend,
because great software is only possible with effective collaboration.
