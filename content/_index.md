ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nan. While trained as a statistician, I'm driven by a passion for
building better software. This unique perspective informs my approach to
turning rigorous statistical methods into intuitive tools people love to use.

Whether it's contributing to healthcare research or open source projects,
I'm always focusing on creating effective software that is also accessible,
reliable, and maintainable for everyone involved, from scientists to engineers.

My commitment to better software extends to developer experience (DevEx).\
I enjoy designing development workflows that teams can adopt, extend, and
collaborate on, because great software is only possible with great workflows.
