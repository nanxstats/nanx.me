ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nan. I build statistical software to
help data scientists tackle real-world problems.
</p>

Whether it's developing new statistical methods, analyzing complex datasets,
or architecting software solutions, I thrive on confronting
challenging problems. My passion lies in creatively bridging the gap
between statistics, computing, and human decision-making, all while
maintaining a personal touch.

Read my [blog](blog/) to discover my thoughts on data science and
statistical software design. You can also explore my
[software](software/), [papers](papers/), [talks](talks/), and [books](books/).
