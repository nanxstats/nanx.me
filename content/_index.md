ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nan.
While trained as a statistician, I'm fundamentally driven by a passion for
building better software. This unique perspective informs my approach to
turning rigorous statistical methods into intuitive tools people love to use.

Whether I'm contributing to healthcare research or open source projects,
my focus is always on creating software that is not only effective,
but also genuinely accessible, reliable, and maintainable for everyone involved,
from scientists to engineers.

My commitment to better software extends to developer experience (DevEx).
I enjoy designing and enabling development workflows that teams can adopt,
extend, and collaborate on, because great software is only possible
with great workflows.
