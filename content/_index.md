ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nan. I build statistical software to
help data scientists tackle real-world problems.
</p>

Whether it's developing new statistical methods, analyzing complex datasets,
or architecting software solutions in R and Python, I thrive on confronting
challenging problems. My deepest passion lies in creatively bridging the gap
between statistics, computing, and human decision-making, all while
maintaining a personal touch.
