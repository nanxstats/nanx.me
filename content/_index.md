Hi there! This is Nan.

My research focuses on developing scalable statistical machine learning
methods to detect key signals and reveal meaningful patterns from
high-dimensional biological/chemical data.
My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is
[4](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576).

I build open source software for statistical learning,
data visualization, and computational reproducibility.
My most popular R packages include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), [protr](https://nanx.me/protr/),
and [liftr](https://liftr.me/)
([John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award](http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/index.html), 2018).

My industry experience dedicates to building tailored, cloud-based
data analysis solutions for the leading pharmaceutical & life science
research organizations in the world.
By connecting the dots in data science and product engineering,
my mission is to make genomic data analysis faster, cheaper,
[collaborative](https://nanx.me/talks/#talk-bostonbiocmeetup),
and [reproducible](https://nanx.me/talks/#poster-dockflow).
