Hi! I'm **Nan Xiao**, a statistician working at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/).
My current research focus is on group sequential design methods for late-phase oncology trials.

Previously, I worked as a genomic data scientist at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Earlier in my career, I studied Human Genetics in [Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.
I earned my PhD degree in Statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for high-dimensional data analysis,
advised by [Prof. Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
My [Erd≈ës number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576) is 4.

I'm interested in discovering the connections between things.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my computational workflow.
My favorite works include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/), [stackgbm](https://nanx.me/stackgbm/), [oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/), [liftr](https://liftr.me/), and [ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/).

I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
When I'm not working, I enjoy playing squash and running along the [Charles River](https://unsplash.com/photos/Npxns5Xj2YQ).
