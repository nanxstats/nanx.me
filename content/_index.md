I am a statistician working at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/).
My research interests include sparse linear models,
representation learning, and computational reproducibility.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my workflow.
My favorites include
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[stackgbm](https://nanx.me/stackgbm/),
[oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/),
[liftr](https://liftr.me/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/),
and
[pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at
[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) in Boston.
Earlier in my career, I studied human genetics in
[Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
at the University of Chicago.
I earned my PhD degree in statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for
high-dimensional data analysis, advised by
[Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I currently live in Lansdale, Pennsylvania.
In my free time, I enjoy expanding and curating my Steam game collection,
and (actually) playing some of them with friends.
