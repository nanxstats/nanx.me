Hi! I'm **Nan Xiao**, a statistician working at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/).
My current research interests include sparse linear models,
computational reproducibility, and group sequential design.
I enjoy discovering the serendipitous connections between things.
I build [statistical software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my workflow.
My favorite works include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/), [oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/), [liftr](https://liftr.me/), [ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), and [pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Earlier in my career, I studied Human Genetics in [Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.
I earned my PhD degree in Statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for high-dimensional data analysis,
advised by [Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
My [Erd≈ës number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576) is 4.

I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
In my free time, I often play squash and run along the [Charles River](https://unsplash.com/photos/Npxns5Xj2YQ).
