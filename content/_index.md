ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nan --- a statistician by training, a software builder at heart.
I specialize in building statistical and research software where
robust implementation meets intuitive design.

Whether advancing healthcare research or contributing to open source,
my focus is always on transforming real-world complexities into reliable,
accessible, and maintainable solutions.

My commitment to software extends to developer experience (DevEx).
I design workflows that teams can adopt and extend,
because great software is only possible with great collaboration.
