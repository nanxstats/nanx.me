ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nan---a statistician by training and a software builder at heart.
I design and ship research software where rigorous methodology meets clean,
dependable engineering.

I work across clinical research, machine learning, and open source tooling,
turning real-world constraints into systems that are reliable, accessible,
and maintainable.

I care deeply about developer experience. Clear APIs, strong tests, and
automation are baked into my workflows so teams can adopt, extend,
and collaborate with confidence.
