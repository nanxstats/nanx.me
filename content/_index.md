ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nan.
As a statistician and software developer, I build practical, user-centric tools
where robust implementation meets intuitive design.

Whether I'm contributing to healthcare research or open source projects,
my focus is always on creating software that is not only effective, but also
genuinely accessible, reliable, and maintainable for everyone involved.

I'm also passionate about developer experience,
enabling workflows that are a pleasure for teams to reuse and build upon.
I believe great software should empower everyone who interacts with it,
from scientists to engineers.
