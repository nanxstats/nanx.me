Hi! I'm **Nan Xiao**, a statistician working at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/).
My research interests include sparse linear models,
translational bioinformatics, and computational reproducibility.
I enjoy discovering the serendipitous connections between things.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my workflow.
My favorites include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[oneclust](https://nanx.me/oneclust/), [liftr](https://liftr.me/), 
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), and [pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at
[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) in Boston, MA.
Earlier in my career, I studied human genetics in [Matthew Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.
I earned my PhD degree in statistics from Central South University, China.
My thesis focused on developing statistical machine learning methods for
high-dimensional data analysis, advised by
[Qing-Song Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b98MXiYAAAAJ&hl=en).
My [Erd≈ës number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576)
is 4.

I currently live in Cambridge, MA.
In my free time, I love playing squash, running along the

and exploring downtown Boston.
