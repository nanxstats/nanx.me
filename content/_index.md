Hi! I'm Nan --- a statistician by training, a software builder at heart.
I build and ship statistical and research software where dependable
engineering meets intuitive design.

I work across clinical research, machine learning, and open source tooling,
turning real-world constraints into systems that are reliable, accessible,
and maintainable.

My commitment to software extends to developer experience.
I design workflows that teams can adopt and extend, because great
software is only possible with great collaboration.
